esnext lets you use upcoming JavaScript syntax in today's runtime environments. It does this by turning JavaScript written using new syntax into JavaScript that uses syntax understood by modern runtime environments such as browsers and node.js.

For more on getting started with esnext, check out the [project README][README].
